Project Specifications


Overview: The game is called Bullshi*t, a game about bluffing your opponents to victory. The lobbies will consist of 3-8 players. A single deck of 52 cards is dealt to all participants. The goal of the game is to get rid of all your cards. The order of the cards that are supposed to be put down are in a repeating order of card ranking from A to K.  The person who has the Ace of Spades goes first. Players have the ability to bluff what they put down for their turn. For example, the person who is supposed to play the ace of spades first can claim to put down 3 aces but in reality it’s one ace and 2 other cards. The goal of the game is to get rid of all your cards. Whoever can get rid of all of their cards first, wins.
